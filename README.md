# TaxCalc

---

Good morning, Mr(s) President! Everybody seems to be clamoring for tax reform, but everybody has their own idea of what that should look like. Some people want to lower taxes across the board, others want huge tax cuts for the very top earners, some people want to tax the super-rich mercilessly so as to alleviate the growing income disparity in this country. Some people even advocate for a negative income tax on low earners! It's up to you, as our elected leader and user of this amazing web-app, to come up with a tax structure that makes sense to YOU. Are you a ruthless libertarian or fair-minded socialist? Perhaps you're a milquetoast centrist who thinks the answer lies somewhere in the middle?

Give it a whirl, see what happens. Create your own tax brackets and see what happens to your income! Have fun, Mr(s) President, and remember: you can't please everybody!
